Webshop where you can buy one/ multiple items.

Having my own company I have designed a webpage specifically for computers and laptops but after a long marketing reaserch I have found out that the most users use their phone for ordering and buying items online.In order to not miss a great deal of possible customers I have come up with a new android webshop for future customers.
Moreover, the main idea of the webshop is Customisable products.
Each user has to submit a picture of their pet in order for us to engrave it into hardwood (for future into metal).If the picture is not submitted then we can not porceed with the order.
If the quality of the picture is too blurry,shady,moved we can not porceed with the order.

The main page will contain the products, which are clickabale pictures. Multiple products are placed in either a slideshow where you press/swipe and the picture of the product changes or scroll down , where you have to scroll the page in order to view the products.

The top of the bage will contain the logo, which is either in the middle or in one of the corners, a search button, an cart button with drop-down functions, a 3-line button where you can see all the pages(eg. Catalog, Photoguideline, Delivery Information and Legal Pages + Contact us)

In the cart, the customer can view their products, can delete them or add another.The cart will show all the products that the user has selected without having to scroll or press any other button.
Swiping back from another page which is not the main page will directly land the customer on the main page.

In the product page, there will be multiple pictures from previous customers who bought the product and in addition there will also be a review section where the customer can leave a review.

The contact page will have a form which the user has to submit in order for his/her question to be answe
red by the company's customer support.

In the payment page there will be the general fileds(ex. name, street) then it will redirect the customer to the payment page.
